    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all Ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        <p>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion and garlic in a Dutch oven<br>
           over medium heat until well browned.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with<br>
          sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel<br>`
          seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 ½ hours, stirring occasionally.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water<br>
           for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons<br>
           parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>To assemble, spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.<br>
          Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly.<br>
          Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices.<br>
          Spoon 1 ½ cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover<br>
          with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure<br>
          the foil does not touch the cheese.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an<br>
          additional 25 minutes.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</p>
